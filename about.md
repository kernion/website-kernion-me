<p>A few personal/professional things about me that don't fit elsewhere on this site:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm fascinated with localization (as opposed to translation) and the ways in which translators change the meaning of words to fit a different culture instead of literally translating them. Many technical communication teams adopt minimalist style guides for content that will be translated or localized, so it was a delight to watch translators work with wordplay and slang when I managed the Indeed Engineering blog. They successfully handled jokes about "Jabberwocky" and Bugs Bunny, among other pop references. I've learned not to presume the limitations of localization.</li>
<li>In 2022, I volunteered to proofread a local League of Women Voters guide ... in Chinese and Vietnamese. I don't read either language. How did I do it? A <em>lot</em> of attention to detail.</li>
<li>I worked as a freelance film writer from 2005 to 2017. In 2006, I founded Slackerwood, a website focusing on Austin film news and events. It grew in size/audience until I was managing seven regular contributors plus guest writers/photographers. Slackerwood was underwritten by Austin Film Society from 2012-2014, and won an <em>Austin Chronicle</em> Best of Austin 2011 award for Best Austin Movie Blog. Publication ceased in 2015, although the archives are <a href="http://slackerwood.com" target="_blank">still available</a>.</li>
<li>I also contributed reviews and features to Cinematical/Moviefone, Variety, Indiewire, SXSWorld Magazine, and Crooked Marquee.</li>
<li>One of my favorite reviews is <em><a href="https://www.slackerwood.com/node/4313" target="_blank">Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</a></em>, because I wrote it as if it were part of a users' guide for film critics.</li>
</ul>
