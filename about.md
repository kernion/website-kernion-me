<p>A few personal/professional things about me that don't fit elsewhere on this site:</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe one excellent way technical writers/tech comm teams can fit in with an engineering culture is to participate in company hackathons. In 2014, I persuaded my tech comm team at Bazaarvoice to create a hackathon team -- the first all-writer team. We won the "Closest to Reality" award for evolving a wizard-like site for SEO developer resources.</li>
<li>I worked as a freelance film writer from 2005 to 2017. In 2006, I founded Slackerwood, a website focusing on Austin film news and events. It grew in size/audience until I was managing seven regular contributors plus guest writers/photographers. Slackerwood was underwritten by Austin Film Society from 2012-2014, and won an <em>Austin Chronicle</em> Best of Austin 2011 award for Best Austin Movie Blog. Publication ceased in 2015, although the archives are <a href="http://slackerwood.com">still available</a>.</li>
<li>I also contributed reviews and features to Cinematical/Moviefone, Variety, Indiewire, SXSWorld Magazine, and Crooked Marquee.</li>
<li>My favorite review is <em><a href="https://www.slackerwood.com/node/4313">Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</a></em>, written in a cranky editor's style. Can't imagine why I would pick that tone.</li>
<li>I'm trying to learn Japanese on Duolingo. I've been working on this for two years so far. When I do go back to Tokyo someday, I should at least be able to order food more coherently and apologize more eloquently.</li>
</ul>
<p>About this site:</p>
<p>This portfolio website is sourced on GitHub and uses GitHub Pages with a Jekyll theme called <a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/typewriter">Typewriter</a>. I use Visual Studio Code to edit and publish content. I have Jekyll installed on a Windows 10 computer to preview content before publishing.</p>
